00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
nmap

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.530
map is a ports scanner, that is to say

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.910
a tool that will allow you to test

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.470
all the possible ways of

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.509
communicating with a remote server, it

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.710
goes for this one is to identify which

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.120
ports are open, that is to say the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.309
channels  then what are the services that

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.769
respond behind the basic syntax is

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.320
nmap followed by the ip and the server with

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.579
this command n will try to

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.619
determine if among the 1000

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.419
most frequent ports some are open on

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:24.259
the remote machine

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.539
if we want to browse  all the

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.310
ports then it will be necessary to add the -

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.560
p - option among the main options and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.299
we have the sv option which will ask to 

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.250
nmap to obtain the version numbers of the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.840
detected services there is also

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.520
the - o option  which will attempt to identify

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.490
the oparating system of the machine and finally the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.680
sc option which will run a series of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.960
default scripts has to detect some

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.710
common vulnerabilities

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.559
these three sv options to the tests can

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.390
be grouped into a single argument  -A

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.070
here is for the essential and to know

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.450
more do not forget to consult the masne
